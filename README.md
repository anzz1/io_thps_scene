# io_thps_scene
An addon for Blender which allows you to export scenes as custom levels/models for a selection of classic Tony Hawk games. Existing levels and other assets from these games can also be imported into a scene. Also includes an automated lightmap baking tool!
Supports exporting to THUG1, THUG2/THUG PRO, and THPS4 (experimental). Assets can be imported from the original THPS up to THUG2. 

## Installation/Documentation
The full installation and documentation can be found at http://tharchive.net/misc/io_thps_scene.html
You can download the addon from there, or grab the newest release on GitHub. It should be a zip file containing two other zip files. Extract the one that corresponds to your Blender version:
 - `io_thps_scene_blender2.79.zip` is for Blender 2.79
 - `io_thps_scene_blender2.8.zip` is for Blender 2.8+. Has been developed on 2.83 LTS, but should be compatible with 2.9

 Ensure the zip file you extract is renamed to `io_thps_scene.zip`, or the installation may not work correctly. Once done, go to Blender's addon manager, click 'Install add-on from file', then choose the zip file you just created. The addon should then appear in the list - click the checkbox to activate it.

 There are a few options you can configure, such as viewport colors and menu options. If you wish to use game asset integration, then configure the path to your THPS game installation(s) here. 

## Examples 
I host a selection of custom levels built with this addon on the Tony Hawk Archive: http://tharchive.net/misc/custom_levels.html
You can also find a larger collection of custom levels at THPSX: http://thpsx.com/community-upload-list/

## 2.79 Support
The version of the addon for Blender 2.79 is currently still supported, but this will change at some point in the future as development moves exclusively to the 2.8x version. If you're still on 2.79, consider updating if you want to get continue getting new features from this addon.
